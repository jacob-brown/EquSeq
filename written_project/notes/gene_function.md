Ten years of horse genomics...

A number of phenotypic traits of interest and disease traits were identified using these arrays, including Lavender Foal Syndrome (Brooks et al. 2010), alternate gait (Andersson et al. 2012), iris color variation (Mack et al. 2017) and ocular squamous cell carcinoma (Bellone et al. 2017; Tables 2 and 3). Additionally, these resources were used to identify breed specific signatures of selection (Petersen et al. 2013b) that aid in our understanding of the biology behind performance and other selected traits in the horse (Andersson et al. 2012; Petersen et al. 2014b).
