fasq fiels from ENA may be pair ended or single.

`_1` and `_2` note paired, .fastq.gz is the unmapped reads
if only .fastq.gz then it is single-ended


### Generated fastq files
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browse/read-download#downloading_files_ftp



`For paired experiments with two application reads reads will be made available in 1-3 fastq files. If a paired experiment is submitted with both application reads then the first reads will be in <run accession>_1.fastq.gz file, the second reads will be in <run accession>_2.fastq.gz, and any unpaired reads will be in <run accession>.fastq.gz file. In case a paired experiment is submitted containing only unpaired reads then only a single file will be created: <run accession>.fastq.gz.`
