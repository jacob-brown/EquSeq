## Introduction
### Background
Unique and interesting
	Oldest sequenced genome
		560–780 kyr BP Pleistocene horse - Orlando et al. 2013 
	Pre and post domestication
	Parallel wild vs domestication
	Extensive WGSs from ancient and modern horses - Raudsepp 2019

Current states
	Horses
		Wild 
		Ancient
		modern-bred
		domesticated-fereal? 
	Technologies
		EquCab3 - Kalbfleisch 2018

Domestication
	Deleterious mutations - ref
	many remits, geographically and culturally linked
	agriculture, warfare transport, leisure - Fages 2019
	16% drop in genetic diversity over the last 200 years - Fages 2019
		highlights importance of NGS and this study 


### Gaps
Zonkey Pipeline - admixture from ancient DNA, equine F1-hybrids - Schubert 2017
Drivers of patterns we observe
Lack of tools for breeders and researchers to infer ancestry and admixture in modern horse breeds
Timing of selection on specific traits during domestication events only touched upon - Fages 2019



### This project
Complex evolutionary history
Aim to 
Utilise exensive horse WGSs to develop a standardised process for infering ancestry and admixing 

### Aims
1) Develop a bioinformatics pipeline to gather and process genomic data from different breeds and natural populations of horses
2) Develop a tool that can infer ancestry and admixture.
3) Infer ancestry and admixture during domestication events from publicly available WGSs and a novel sample

CMEE Masters project proposals should be written in LATEX, and the source code submitted (pushed), in pdf format to your git repository into a directory called Proposal inside a Project directory. 

Set deadlines for intro etc. - 1st month
end of 1st third - methods finished
end of 2nd third - analysis and results section
last third - write up and code publish
