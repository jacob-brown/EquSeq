============

Main aim: examine the evolutionary histories of the horse, by describing ancestries and admixture of modern, historic, wild, and domesticated populations

Specific aims: 

1. Develop a bioinformatics pipeline to gather and process genomic data from different breeds and natural populations of horses.

2. Extend the pipeline to infer ancestry and admixture.

3. Infer patterns of evolutionary histories of E. caballus from publicly available WGSs and a novel sample.

4. Develop a user-friendly tool that would allow breeders and researchers to infer ancestries of E. caballus sequences.

============
To do:
Look at matteo summer guide


============
### Aim 1: bioinformatics pipeline
How? 
gather data, but what kind? WGS? SRA?


============
### Aim 2: ancestry and admixture
How? 

Introgression and admixture
Structure
PCA to separate out the groups?
Przewalski’s horse ancestry looked at a lot - possibly avoid

Maximum Likelihood (ML): ADMIXTURE
Bayesian: STRUCTURE

============
### Aim 3: patterns of evolutionary histories
How? 
Haplotypes
Gene specific adaptations?
Bottlenecks
Inbreeding
Fst


============
### Aim 4: tool
How? 



============
Timing of selection on specific traits during domestication events only touched upon - Fages 2019

Przewalski’s horse ancestry looked at a lot
