When the sample is returned...
1. Quality control (given in FASTQ file)
2. Mapping onto reference genome
3. Determine genotype likilihood
	Due to low coverage there might be some errors from the sequencing, and we would need to determine the probability of the genotype occuring for all possibilities

Possible starting file formats:
	FASTQ (raw output from sequencer)
	BAM(Binary of SAM file, mapped/processed)

If BAM files are used the pipline and methods should be the same, as otherwise we won't be able to compare the sequences. 

FASTQ would allow us to use our own mapping and pipeline, however will be alot more work. 

First we will explore the use of BAM files, later we may consider FASTQ and our own system. 


1. Available Data
Look at Orlando
Collect all available data (everything!)
What sort of format is it in? FASTQ, BAM?
What pipeline/protocols where used? are they comparable?
Pipeline and protocol should be comparable. 
Where is it from?

Ancient DNA (extra)
needs to be anlysied seperatly from the modern, and should be done after the gathering of the modern samples. 
Common issues: Less coverage, potential contamination, DNA damage, transition/transversion tends to be an issue, centre of fragments is usually good but edges are not. 
When and where is it from?

2. Pipeline/Protocol
from Orlando - how was the data processed?
Mapping softwares - samtools etc. 

3. Analysis
AMSD, NGSTOOLS, etc. 
Admixture plots, PCAs, trees, etc. 
lots can be done. 


For the writeup we should aim for a hypothesis driven approach. We use the sample and want to find out the ancestry, mixture, etc. Rather than a methods write-up.

Step 1: gather information regaring the available data, fromat, and the pipeline used.
